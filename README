# Bare Metal Keypad Calculator using Custom LCD Driver (AVR)

A fully functional calculator implemented in bare-metal Embedded C using direct register manipulation, without relying on external libraries. The system interfaces a 4x4 matrix keypad and an HD44780 LCD using custom low-level drivers.

This project demonstrates firmware-level hardware control, driver development, and peripheral interfacing.
